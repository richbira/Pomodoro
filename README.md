# Pomodoro Timer GUI App 🍅
How to become more productive!

Welcome to the Pomodoro (Tomato) Timer GUI app! This application is designed to help you become more productive by using the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique involves working on a task for 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro") and then taking a short 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 minutes. This cycle helps improve focus and productivity.

# How to use Pomodoro/ Tomato timers

2) Set the timer for 25 minutes (one Pomodoro) and start working on the task.
3) When the timer completes, take a 5-minute short break.
4) After completing four Pomodoros, take a 15-minute long break.
5) Repeat the process from step 1.

- Final Result: You have worked for 100 minutes and took 15 minutes break!
